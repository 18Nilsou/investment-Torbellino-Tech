# Instructions of the test
1. First, you need to read the following book (you do not need to read the whole
book (see below)): https://www.distributedconsensus.net/. The link might
be broken but you can get a copy with the email sent.
2. Second, you need to read this program, that we will call investment-p (you
do not need to read the whole program (see below)): https://github.com/
TorbellinoTech/investment
3. When reading the program investment-p, you are expected to pay special attention to the market_sim folder and its contents. You will notice many folders are
missing with respect to the README Project Structure.
4. Fork investment-p from TorbellinoTech’s github to your github.
5. Download your fork of investment-p.
6. Given the contents of the book and investment-p, write some new code that
implements some concept found in the book under some of the directories found
in the Project Structure.
7. Write also some tests and/or some visualizations.
8. Push the changes to your repository.
9. Send an email (or call) updating to the contact below.

# Further instructions or notes
• All the code must be open source and readily available for reading and testing.
